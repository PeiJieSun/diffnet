### Basic Information:
This code is released for the paper: 

Le Wu, Junwei Li, Peijie Sun, Richang Hong, Yong Ge, and Meng Wang. DiffNet++: A Neural Influence and Interest Diffusion Network for Social Recommendation. Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering in Dec 2020. 

DiffNet++ is improved on [DiffNet](https://github.com/PeiJieSun/diffnet), for more details, please refer to the paper from the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00844), the final version will be updated soon.

### Usage:
1. Environment: python2.7, tensorflow-gpu-1.12.0
2. Download datasets from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YAJvgsCJLKDFPVFMX3OG7v3m1LAYZD5R?usp=sharing), and just put the downloaded folder 'data' in the root directory of 'DiffNet++'. 
3. Start with the command `python entry.py --data_name=<data_name> --model_name=<model_name> --gpu=<gpu id>`, any available gpu device can be used by specifying the gpu id, or you can just ignore the gpu id. 


Example:
`python entry.py --data_name=yelp --model_name=diffnetplus`
